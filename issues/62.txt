In such case 

~~~csharp
  public void Home()
        {
            HomeY();
            HomeX();
            HomeC();
        }
~~~

Sample changer will make reference run for all axes simultaneously. It's dangerous.

We have to wrap movement methods to tasks and process task result or set continuation.
