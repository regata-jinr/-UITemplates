- irradiations
- measurements
- m.b. even for weighting

The base of such form will be the next one:

Third field shouldn't use rdgv.

It should be separated control and have constructor with two parameters:

- first int is the number of tabs
- second int is the number of dgv on the each tab

All logic such as queries and initialization of dgv will be external based on datasource property.

The question is how to generate dgv or I have to predefined it for a big number case as null?

What is the best way to generalize functionality and pass the data from field 3 to 2?
