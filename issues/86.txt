Right now nuget package will be generated only in vase of build via VS.

I have to add RunPack function to build.ps1

I can do this with further command
```poweshell
nuget pack .\src\Base\Base.csproj -Build  -Properties Configuration=Release
```

However in this case something wrong with file path:

```powershell
Could not find a part of the path '...\src\Base\bin\Release\Base\bin\Release'.
```
