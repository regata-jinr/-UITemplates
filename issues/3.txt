I think that all code should be combine into the one repo like [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)

For example 
- Regata
- Regata/Hardware/Detector.dll
- Regata/Hardware/SampleChanger.dll
- Regata/Core/Settings/Settings.dll
- Regata/DataBase/Context/
- Regata/DataBase/Models/
- Regata/GUI/WinFormsPrimitives/
...

After that I can use this libraries in other application repoes.

How to merge commits into one repo.
Split development to the branches. See  [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)
Prepare cicd for nuget?
