Despite on the fact of existing RegisterForm template it's very much the same work for really closer functional of registers:

- In Measurements.Desktop I have empty Measurements register that could be filled
- In DBC I should have both registers: Irradiation as for viewing and also for filling and Measurement register only for viewing.

Now I just copy paste already implemented functional from Measurements.Desktop, but it's obviously I have to combine how many functionality as possible into already existed template.
