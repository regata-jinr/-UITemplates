The problem was that there was separate query for each control. So we have very much queries just to get string.

We can avoid it if we will load all labels, but now if I will do it in static constructor of Labels it will not allow us to split label by form name. I have to load it in the constructor of the form and figure out switching language by the default mechanism using resources.

If we will work in such manner switching language for different forms will not work. As well as we have to split tests from one to each functionality:
switching
different forms switching
