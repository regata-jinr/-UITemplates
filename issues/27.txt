Now the problem is that we have 20 dll files as a products of Regata.Core. In case I'm using it inside Regata.Core solution this fine, because I can just reference to a specific project, e.g. almost each assembly  references to Regata.Core.Report.dll.

I have to setup msbuild  build all projects and run all tests in solution to specific folder and use this folder for referencing in other projects.
