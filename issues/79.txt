During each movement we can track position and check it with predefined zones.
Zones could be differ by speed and safety.
In speed zone (e.g. (MaxY, [HomeX;AboveCellInternalDiskX]) we can increase speed.
In safety zones we can deny some movement. In case of inside detector shield app can move only along Y axis.
