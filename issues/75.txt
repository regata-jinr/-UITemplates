It is very useful to save states of instances of complex types in some running points.

E.g. state of sample changer could contain axis positions, reference switches, err state, and so on. 
We can save such state in the some running points, e.g. before measurement start or in case of error.

It will allow us to detect problems fast and will very good addition part for logs.
