I would like to have list only from available detectors, not all devices on machine.

I can request such list asynchronous with cancel by timeout in order to avoid freezing.

~~~csharp
 var dev1 = new DeviceAccess();
dev1.Connect("D1", ConnectOptions.aReadWrite);
Console.WriteLine(dev1.IsConnected);
var dev2 = new DeviceAccess();
dev2.Connect("D1", ConnectOptions.aReadWrite);
~~~

Such code working fine. New instance of DeviceAccess allows to connect the same detector twice.
In case of handle connection from mvcg IsDetectorAvailable("D1") working correctly.

[I can test it via running putview and pvopen processes](https://github.com/regata-jinr/Core/issues/52)
