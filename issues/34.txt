Regarded with comment from #30 we have to implement control based on TabControl.

It should have:

- [x] Number of pages number and number of dgvs on each page in constructor
- [x] Some size linked parameter. I think we can use float number from 0 to 1 which lead to size of right dgv.
- [x] Pages property that allows to get TabPageCollection
- [x] ActivePage proeprty that return selected tab
- [x] indexer based on [i,j] where i - page index, j dgv index
- [x] label above each dgv
