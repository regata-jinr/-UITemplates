Almost each form in our apps have a table.

Here is the list of functions and states of the table:

- [x] Read information from db
- [x] Save information to db (automatically choose update or insert)
- [x] Data validation
- [x] Converting of internal field names to human understandable column header with support of switching language
- [x] Set readonly columns
- [x] Show/hide selected columns
- [x] Save state of the table. This means that hided columns names should be save to file settings and load after running.

I think the best way to implement this is abstract generic class based on datagridview where the generic type is data model class.
