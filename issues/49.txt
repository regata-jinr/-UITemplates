The idea of language switching is that switching from any form should call switching for rest app forms.

Here the schema of such behavior for testing purposes:

- Create first form based on RegisterForm with name TestLangSwitching1
- Create second form based on RegisterForm with name TestLangSwitching2
- Fill UILabels table with special text field
- Test correct language loading from setting file
- Switch language by performing click on lang item from first form
- Check switching fact for both forms
- Repeat with opposite order

Multiswitching does not work now:

In order to switch language we have to add such instructions for each form based on RegisterForm:

~~~csharp
 var rf = new RegisterForm<Measurement>(Settings<MeasurementsSettings>.CurrentSettings.CurrentLanguage);
 rf.LangItem.CheckItem(Settings<MeasurementsSettings>.CurrentSettings.CurrentLanguage);
 rf.LangItem.CheckedChanged += () => { Settings<MeasurementsSettings>.CurrentSettings.CurrentLanguage = rf.LangItem.CheckedItem; Labels.SetControlsLabels(rf.Controls); };

// in the end of constructor
Labels.SetControlsLabels(rf.Controls); 
~~~
