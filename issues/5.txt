In such case we provide to users more control for notification.

E.g. we can provide CriticalErrorsList so in case of occurred error in the list it will generate email


- [ ] Move to settings specific codes for any notification (success, info, warning, error)
- [ ] Create strong link for these with Notification Level
- [ ] Each code has default English message, but user can change it to any language in GUI. What mechanism to such replacement?
- [ ] Notification with error code should be called automatically in case of exception
- [ ] In any case notification could be called by hand with only code parameter
- [ ] It means I have to pass only the code and it automatically generate other parameters such as message, title(sender) and call event for correspond gui wrapper

I can provide error codes enumeration separate for each library, but in this case some of error will be doubled, e.g. DB_ERRROR.

Or I can make common errors for errors  with db and additional as parameter specific errors...

Based on the code of error I can provide messages for any language. Title autogenerated from stack trace?
