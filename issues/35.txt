In the issue #30  we announce generalized view for registers.

Now let's think how we can generalized passing of data from DGVTabPaneControl to RDataGridView via functional field?

Functional field allows us to manipulate main table, but manipulations could be different. It may make changes to main table or fill the main table from additional table from DGVTabControl.

Anyway manipulation strictly depends about type of register and could not be generalized.

But what we can do it provides easy access to selected cells from dgv from active tab page

Functional field based on TableLayoutPanel. User will be able to add any control to that field and functionality.
