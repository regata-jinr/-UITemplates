I can switch limits and reference switcher. In order to do this I have to use 

~~~csharp
 XemoDLL.MB_IoSet(axisNum, 0, 3, XemoConst.InPolarity, value);
~~~

~~~
_InPolarity(_x.2) = 1 Invert polarity of the reference switch if it is an opener
_InPolarity(_x.0..1) = 3 Invert polarity of the limit switch (3 dec. -> 1111) if opener
_InPolarity(10.0..3) = 15 Invert polarity of the inputs In0 to In3 (15 -> 1111) 
_InPolarity(10.0) = 1 "Polarity" of the dig. entry 10.0 will be changed to opener 
_InPolarity(0.0..2) = 7 "Polarity" the limit switch (inputs 0 and 1) and of the reference switch (input 2) of motor X (port 0) will be changed to opener. The binary statement "7" means that the last 3 bits (bits 0 to 2) are set (111).
